Design concept	
I am going to design a site with boxes overlapping each other with varying depths. 
I would like to try and style each box with its own font and try to have the fonts complement each other throughout the five main sections of text. 
Color scheme will be subdued earth tones. 
I am affecting the user by guiding the eye through the design with colors and overlapping boxes.
